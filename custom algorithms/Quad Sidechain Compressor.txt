SIDECHAIN "in 1, 2, 3, 4" is feedforward, "out 1, 2, 3, 4" is feedback (post-MAKEUPGAIN & DRY/WET MIX), and "in 5, 6, 7, 8" is the external sidechain input.

CUTS filter the sidechain signal.

DRY/WET MIX is post-LOOKAHEAD.

LINK BESIDE controls how much 1+3 (or 5+7) compresses 2 and 4, and how much 2+4 (or 6+8) compresses 1 and 3.

LINK ACROSS controls how much 1 (or 5) compresses 3, 2 (or 6) compresses 4, 3 (or 7) compresses 1, and 4 (or 8) compresses 2.

For natural sounding compression make sure LINK BESIDE is always >= LINK ACROSS.

Outputs 5, 6, 7, and 8 are just inputs 5, 6, 7, and 8 passed through unprocessed.
